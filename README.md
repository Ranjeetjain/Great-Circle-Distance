# Great-Circle-Distance

## Understanding Great Circle Distance

The great-circle distance, orthodromic distance, or spherical distance is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, measured along the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight line through the sphere's interior).


## Understanding

All the required calculations to find GCD for a two given latitude and longitude is written inside the great_circle_distance.py file.
> the calculate methods does all the validations and calculate the GCD.

# Requirements
Python3.*

# Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. `python main.py`
3. to run the test cases `python great_circle_distance.test.py`
